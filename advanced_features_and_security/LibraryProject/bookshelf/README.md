# LibraryProject - Bookshelf App

## Overview
This project involves managing a library system with custom user models, permissions, and groups.

## Custom User Model
The `CustomUser` model extends Django's `AbstractUser` model with additional fields:
- `date_of_birth`: A date field to store the user's birth date.
- `profile_photo`: An image field to store the user's profile photo.

### Custom User Manager
- `create_user`: Manages the creation of regular users with the additional fields.
- `create_superuser`: Manages the creation of superusers and ensures required fields are set.

## Permissions and Groups

### Custom Permissions
The `Book` model includes custom permissions:
- `can_view`: Allows viewing of book details.
- `can_create`: Allows creation of new book entries.
- `can_edit`: Allows editing of existing book entries.
- `can_delete`: Allows deletion of book entries.

### Groups
- **Editors**: Assigned `can_create` and `can_edit` permissions.
- **Viewers**: Assigned `can_view` permission.
- **Admins**: Assigned all permissions including `can_delete`.

## Views with Permission Checks
The `book_list` view in `views.py` checks for the `can_view` permission before listing books.

```python
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_view', raise_exception=True)
def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'bookshelf/book_list.html', {'books': books})

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Settings Configuration
The following security settings have been applied in `settings.py`:

- **DEBUG**: Set to `False` in production to prevent sensitive information from being displayed in error pages.
- **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER**: Enabled to prevent cross-site scripting attacks by the browser.
- **X_FRAME_OPTIONS**: Set to `DENY` to prevent clickjacking by disallowing the site to be loaded in an iframe.
- **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF**: Enabled to prevent MIME type sniffing.
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensures that CSRF cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensures that session cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Configured using Django's CSP middleware to limit the domains from which content can be loaded.

### 2. Views and Forms Security
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include the `{% csrf_token %}` tag to protect against CSRF attacks.
- **Safe Data Handling**: Views use Django's ORM with `get_object_or_404` and forms to validate and sanitize user inputs, protecting against SQL injection and other data-related vulnerabilities.

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
The Content Security Policy (CSP) is configured to only allow content from the applicationâ€™s domain and trusted sources. This mitigates the risk of XSS attacks by restricting where scripts and other resources can be loaded from.

### 4. Testing and Validation
To ensure these security measures are effective, the following steps were taken:

- **CSRF Testing**: Forms were tested for proper token inclusion, and submissions were checked to verify protection against CSRF attacks.
- **XSS Testing**: Inputs were tested to confirm that CSP and other browser protections block malicious scripts.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Queries were tested to ensure that they are properly parameterized and protected against SQL injection attempts.
